## Extra Points
1.	To replicate the snail race, this program employs the random and time modules.
2.	The application incorporates rudimentary input validation to guarantee that the user enters a genuine number of snails and names that are unique to each snail.
3.	There is an Easter egg concealed in this code. If you name your snail "Turbo," it will have a secret speed increase that will assist you in winning the race. But, keep in mind that cheating is not permitted, and it is critical to preserve honesty and fairness in any competition.

## Conclusion
Finally, the Escargot Dash code is a simple Python program that mimics a snail race. The code enables users to enter the number of snails and their names, and the script picks a snail at random to advance to the finish line.
The code also includes a cheat code that allows a snail labeled "Turbo" to win automatically and a sleep function that causes a pause before the race begins.
